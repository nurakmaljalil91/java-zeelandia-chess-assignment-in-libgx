# How to run the game
1. install intell J or netbean
2. import the project inside the ide
3. File > Open > ProjectRoot/build.gradle
4. Uncheck 'Create separate module per source set'
5. Select OK on the 'Import Project from Gradle dialog'
6. Once the project has imported you should run a Gradle sync in the IDE to make sure everything is OK. To do this you bring up the Gradle tool window (View > Tool windows > Gradle), and hit the sync button, which is in the top left of the Gradle tool window.

If this succeeds, you are all imported and ready to get developing.
